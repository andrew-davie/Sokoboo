Changes by AD:
- changed LookAround to halt timer when being used
  this should actually PAUSE the game, as we don't want level I allowing you to
  drop the boulders, then "lookaround" and wait for the boulders to drop with timer
  not functional (or even half speed). If you lookaround, the game should stop
  


BUGS/Fixups:
  timer should STOP on loss of life


Conversion:
- convert BD1 to new bankswitching
- clean fixed bank from RAM accessing code
- split kernel draw bank into RAM/row, RAM and ROM
- ...

BD2:
- implement new object's logic (slime, non-rounded magic wall, growing wall)
- define new object graphics
- enhance decode cave
- define new caves
- check dirt color modification
- define new attraction demo
- BD2 music

Beautification:
- more animations for objects
- double Rockford resolution
- more Rockford animations
- uncovering the screen at level start
- fast vertical scrolling
- AD: timer is still going after loss of life
- AD: animation is double-speed when awarding points at end of level
- AD: look-around should not cost time
